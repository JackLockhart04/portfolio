          StocksInSeconds.com is a website for a startup company. I developed
          the backend along with the communications on the frontend. I was able
          to use my knowledge of python and javascript but I had to learn many
          technologies for this project such as Flask API, some AWS, NoSQL, user
          authentication and authorization, cookies, domains, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created the backend in python Flask then realized I needed to host
          it somewhere. I did research and decided that AWS was the best fit due
          to its generous free tier of Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. I
          spent a lot of time learning how AWS works and how to deploy my code
          easily and efficiently. I then created the authentication system using
          Microsoft msal. This created multiple issues that I had to learn about
          such as how cookies work and and safaris strict cookie policy. The
          backend being hosted on a different domain than the frontend messed up
          the cookies so I had to figure out how to use AWS to use a sub domain
          of the website. I finally had to setup payment using stripe to make it
          easy and secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall I learned a lot about many aspects of web development. I had a
          lot of practice with each of the technologies due to my learning
          mistakes along with shifts in the requirements. I feel as though I am
          fairly proficient in python and javascript now but still have plenty
          of learning to do with AWS and depoloyment in general.
